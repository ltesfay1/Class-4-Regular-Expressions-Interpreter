<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this project, you will write an OCaml module to implement
NFAs and regular expressions.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Downloading
<ul>
<li> Download the archive file 
<a href="p3.zip">p3.zip</a> 
and extract its contents.
</ul>

<p>
Along with files used to make direct submissions to the
submit server (<a href="submit.jar">submit.jar</a>, 
<a href=".submit">.submit</a> , 
<a href="submit.rb">submit.rb</a>), you will
find the following project files:

<p>

To test your implementation, you can execute the public tests from the 
command line by typing commands like <tt>ocaml public_RE_to_str.ml</tt>, or you can use the <tt>goTest.rb</tt> script.

Note that to use goTest.rb you must first edit the file and specify which diff program to use.

<p>

For this project you are allowed to use the library
functions found in the Pervasives 
module loaded by default, as well as functions
from the List and String modules.
As in the previous project, you are not
allowed to use imperative OCaml, except for
the <tt>next</tt> function to to generate new
NFA state numbers. You will receive a 0 for any
functions using restricted features - we will be
checking your code!

<h2>Project Description </h2>

<p>
Your job is to implement a module <tt>Nfa</tt> that includes
an API for implementing both NFAs and regular expressions.
The signature and starter implementation for the NFA module is provided.
You may <i>not</i> change the <tt>NFA</tt> signature in
any way, though your implementation may include more
types and functions than are listed in the signature. The
implementation contains a parser you can use to make it easier
to test your implementation. We say more about the parser, below.

<h3>Part 1: NFAs </h3>

<p>
For the first part of this project, you will write a series of
functions to implement NFAs using OCaml.  

<pre>
module type NFA =
  sig
    type nfa
    type transition = int * char option * int
    val make_nfa : int -> int list -> transition list -> nfa
    val e_closure : nfa -> int list -> int list
    val move : nfa -> int list -> char -> int list
    val accept : nfa -> string -> bool
    ...
end
</pre>

<p>
Here are descriptions of the elements of this signature, and what you
need to do to implement them:
<ul>
<li> <tt>type nfa</tt> - This is an <i>abstract type</i> representing
NFAs.  It is up to you to decide exactly how NFAs are implemented.
Since the type is abstract, no client that uses your module will be
able to see exactly how they are implemented.
<p>

<li> <tt>type transition = int * char option * int</tt> - This is a
(non-abstract) type we've made up for convenience to describe an NFA
transition.  In the NFAs for this project, states will simply be
identified by number.  Then <tt>(s0, Some c, s1)</tt> represents a
transition from the state numbered <tt>s0</tt> to the state numbered
<tt>s1</tt>, via an arc labeled with the character <tt>c</tt>.  Notice that
the character is optional---the transition <tt>(s0, None, s1)</tt>
represents an epsilon transition from <tt>s0</tt> to <tt>s1</tt>.
<p>

<li> <tt>make_nfa : int -> int list -> transition list -> nfa</tt>.
This function takes as input the starting state, a list of final
states, and a list of transitions, and returns an NFA.  Again, it is
up to you to decide exactly how NFAs should be implemented, but you
probably do not need to do much more than track these three components
(the starting state, final states, and transition list).  As one example,
<pre>
  let m = make_nfa 0 [2] [(0, Some 'a', 1); (1, None, 2)]
</pre>
sets <tt>m</tt> to be an NFA with start state 0, final state 2, a
transition from 0 to 1 on character <tt>a</tt>, and an epsilon
transition from 1 to 2.
<p>

<li> <tt>e_closure: nfa -> int list -> int list</tt>.  This
function takes as input an nfa and a list of states.
The output will be a list of states
(in any order, with no duplicates) 
that the NFA might be in making zero or more epsilon
transitions, starting from the list of initial states given 
as an argument to e_closure.  For example, letting <tt>m</tt> 
be the NFA above, e_closure would return the following:
<pre>
  e_closure m [0]     (* returns [0]   *)
  e_closure m [1]     (* returns [1;2] *)
  e_closure m [2]     (* returns [2]   *)
  e_closure m [0;1]   (* returns [0;1;2] *)
</pre>
<p>

<li> <tt>move : nfa -> int list -> char -> int list</tt>.  This
function takes as input an nfa, a list of initial states, and a
character.  The output will be a list of states
(in any order, with no duplicates) 
that the NFA might be in after making one transition 
on the character, starting from one of the initial states 
given as an argument to move.  For example, letting
<tt>m</tt> be the NFA above, move would return the following:
<pre>
  move m [0] 'a'    (* returns [1] *)
  move m [1] 'a'    (* returns [] *)
  move m [2] 'a'    (* returns [] *)
  move m [0;1] 'a'  (* returns [1] *)
</pre>

<p>
Notice that the NFA uses an implicit dead state.  If
<tt>s</tt> is a state in the input list and there are no transitions
from <tt>s</tt> on the input character, then all that happens is that
no states are added to the output list for <tt>s</tt>.
<p>

<li><tt>accept : nfa -> string -> bool</tt>.  This function takes an
NFA and a string, and returns true if the NFA accepts the string, and
false otherwise.  You will find functions in the
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/String.html">String library</a> to be helpful.
</ul>

<p>
Note: You need to be a bit careful whenever you combine NFA
representations to be sure that state names (i.e., integers) don't conflict.
You might use the following internal function as an aid in this process:
<ul>
<li><tt>next : unit -> int</tt> - Return a new integer, different from
any values previously returned by <tt>next</tt>.  (This function is defined on
the OCaml slides.)
</ul>

<h3>Part 2: Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>
The second part of this project is to implement regular expressions. 

The signature <tt>NFA</tt> contains the following
declarations:
<pre>
module type NFA =
  sig
     ...
    type regexp =
	Empty_String
      | Char of char
      | Union of regexp * regexp
      | Concat of regexp * regexp
      | Star of regexp

    val regexp_to_string : regexp -> string 
    val regexp_to_nfa : regexp -> nfa
    ...
end
</pre>

    

<p>
Here <tt>regexp</tt> is an user-defined OCaml variant datatype 
that represents regular expressions:
<ul>
<li><tt>Empty_String</tt> represents the regular expression recognizing the
<i>empty string</i> (not the empty set!).  Written as a formal regular expression, this would be <tt>epsilon</tt>.
<p>

<li><tt>Char c</tt> represents the regular expression that accepts the
single character <tt>c</tt>.  Written as a formal regular expression, this would be <tt>c</tt>.
<p>

<li><tt>Union (r1, r2)</tt> represents the regular expression that is
the union of <tt>r1</tt> and <tt>r2</tt>.  For example, <tt>Union(Char
'a', Char'b')</tt> is the same as the formal regular expression <tt>a|b</tt>.
<p>

<li><tt>Concat (r1, r2)</tt> represents the concatenation of
<tt>r1</tt> followed by <tt>r2</tt>.  For example, <tt>Concat(Char
'a', Char 'b')</tt> is the same as the formal regexp <tt>ab</tt>.
<p>

<li><tt>Star r</tt> represents the Kleene closure of regular
expression <tt>r</tt>.  For example, <tt>Star (Union (Char 'a', Char
'b'))</tt> is the same as the formal regexp <tt>(a|b)*</tt>
</ul>

For this part of the project you need to implement the following:

<ul>
<li> <tt>regexp_to_string : regexp -> string </tt> takes a  
a regular expression and returns a string for the regular expression
in the postfix notation used in project 2.  You can do this as a postorder 
DFS traversal over the regexp data structure.

<p>

<li> <tt>regexp_to_nfa : regexp -> nfa </tt> takes a 
<tt>regexp</tt> and returns an NFA that accepts the same 
language as the regular expression.  Unlike project 2, as long as 
your NFA accepts the correct language, the structure of the NFA does 
not matter (since the NFA produced by regexp_to_nfa will only be 
tested by seeing which strings it accepts). 

</ul>

<h3>Provided: Regular Expressions Parser</h3>

<p>
In the starter files we have provided code that parses strings into
<tt>regexp</tt> values. In particular, it implements the following
elements of the signature: 

<pre>
module type NFA =
  sig
     ...
    val string_to_regexp : string -> regexp
    val string_to_nfa : string -> nfa
    exception IllegalExpression of string
end
</pre>

where
<ul>

<li> <tt>string_to_regexp : string -> regexp</tt> takes a string for 
a regular expression, parses the string, and outputs its equivalent 
<tt>regexp</tt>. If the parser determines that the regular expression has
illegal syntax, it will raise an <tt>IllegalExpression</tt> exception.

<li> <tt>string_to_nfa : string -> nfa</tt> takes a string for 
a regular expression, parses the string, converts it into a
<tt>regexp</tt>, and transforms it to an nfa, using your
  <tt>regexp_to_nfa</tt> function. As such, for this functiont to
  work, your <tt>regexp_to_nfa</tt> function must be working.

</ul>

<p>Notes about the grammar for regular expressions implemented by the
provided parser:
<ul>
<li>The regular expressions can contain only <tt>(</tt>, <tt>)</tt>, <tt>|</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, a, b, ..., z and E (for epsilon).
<li>Note that the precedence for regular expressions are as follows, from highest to lowest:
<p>

<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Precedence</th>
<th>Operator</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">Highest</td>
<td align="center"><tt>( )</tt></td>
<td align="center">parentheses</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">|</td>
<td align="center"><tt>*</tt></td>
<td align="center">closure</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">v</td>
<td align="center"><tt>.</tt></td>
<td align="center">concatenation</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">Lowest</td>
<td align="center"><tt>|</tt></td>
<td align="center">union</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>

<li>Note that all the binary operators are <b>right associative</b>.
<li>Your function should throw an <tt>IllegalExpression</tt> exception for invalid regular expressions.
</ul>

Some examples of regular expressions and their equivalent <tt>regexp</tt>
data type are listed in the following table:
<ul>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>String Input</th>
<th><tt>regexp</tt> Output</th>
<th>String Output</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td><tt>Char 'a'</tt></td>
<td>a</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a|b</td>
<td><tt>Union(Char 'a',Char 'b')</tt></td>
<td>a b |</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ab</td>
<td><tt>Concat(Char 'a',Char 'b')</tt></td>
<td>a b .</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>aab</td>
<td><tt>Concat(Char 'a',Concat(Char 'a',Char 'b'))</tt></td>
<td>a a b . .</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(a|E)*</td>
<td><tt>Star(Union(Char 'a',Empty_String))</tt></td>
<td>a E | *</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(a|E)*(a|b)</td>
<td><tt>Concat(Star(Union(Char 'a',Empty_String)),Union(Char 'a',Char 'b'))</tt></td>
<td>a E | * a b | .</td>
</tr>
</table>
</ul>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>
The Campus Senate has adopted a policy asking students to include the
following statement on each assignment in every course: "I pledge on
my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance
on this assignment."  Consequently your program is requested to
contain this pledge in a comment near the top.

<p>
Please <b>carefully read</b> the academic honesty section of the
course syllabus.  <b>Any evidence</b> of impermissible cooperation on
projects, use of disallowed materials or resources, or unauthorized
use of computer accounts, <b>will be submitted</b> to the Student
Honor Council, which could result in an XF for the course, or
suspension or expulsion from the University.  Be sure you understand
what you are and what you are not permitted to do in regards to
academic integrity when it comes to project assignments.  These
policies apply to all students, and the Student Honor Council does not
consider lack of knowledge of the policies to be a defense for
violating them.  Full information is found in the course
syllabus---please review it at this time.
